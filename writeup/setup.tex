\section{Problem Setup}
\label{sec::setup}

Let us formally define the objective function $F$ we are trying to maximize. Consider our elements are part of the universe $\Omega$. We are interested in 

\[
	\max_{\substack{S \subset \Omega \\ |S| \leq l}} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \max_{\substack{T:T \subset S \\ |T| \leq k}} f_i(T)
\]

We define our objective value as $F(S) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \max_{\substack{T:T \subset S \\ |T| \leq k}} f_i(T)$. All functions $f_i$ must be monotone normalized submodular functions. \\

TODO: too similar to sparse comb. rep?? \\
\\
TODO: talk about why objective is not submodular? \\
