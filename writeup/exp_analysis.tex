\subsection{Choices for the functions}

This is up in the air. We need plots here, and discuss what's going on. What kind of plots do we want? Ideas

\begin{itemize}
	\item L fixed increasing K
	\item K fixed increasing L
	\item Matching N, L, K over experiemnts?
	\item Plots of objective value only? We can plot runtime, at least for wiki experiment. That way we compare directly with their implementation and can't be accused of having things inteantionaly too slow on our end. 
	\item ?
\end{itemize}

Also, add anything else?
